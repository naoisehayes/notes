Draw a labelled diagram. Give an example. Explain the formation of the landform focusing on the processes of deposition. State what deposition is and why it occurs. Levees In this answer processes involved in the formation of river levees will be examined. Levees are landforms formed by the processes of river deposition during flooding. Irish example: the banks of the River Moy in County Mayo. The formation of levees A levee is a wide ridge of sediment on the banks of the river. They are landforms of deposition often found in the lower stage of sediments-laden rivers River deposition occurs when the river loses energy and can't carry its load. This can happen for a variety of reasons, e.g. the river may slow down when it floods onto its floodplain and suddenly becomes shallower. Levees form because of flooding. During normal flow the river is confined in its channel and deposition will occur on the river bed. However, during the flood event the river overflows its channel and pours over the floodplain. Once the river has overflowed its channels, it will slow down due to the sudden decrease in debt and the fact that it has escaped its channel and now has a wider area to flow over. The loss of energy causes deposition the heavy stones are deposited first and closest to the banks while finder alluvium is carried further away across the floodplain. Over repeated blood events the deposit of heavy sediment buildup on the banks and form ridges called levees. Levees ar a rivers natural defence against flooding. They keep the river within its channel as every time the river floods it will have to rise higher to escape over the levees. Eventually, deposition on the riverbed combined with the natural levee building leads to a situation where the bed of the river channel is above the level of the floodplain and the levees are the only thing preventing it flowing over the floodplain. When humans reinforce levees or build artificial ones, it can interfere with the rivers natural flood processes and trigger more extreme floods further downstream as has been seen along the rivers Rhine and Mississippi.","title":"levees - Essay"},{"location":"Geography/Waterfalls%20-%20Essay/","text":"Waterfalls What you need to do: Name the landform. Name an Irish example of that landform. Draw a well-labelled diagram. Explain the formation of the landform focusing on the processes of erosion. You must name and explain at least 2 processes of erosion. Waterfalls This answer will examine the processes involved in the formation of waterfalls, landforms formed by river erosion. Irish example: Torc Waterfall, County Kerry. The river erosion processes involved in the formation of a waterfall are hydraulic action, abrasion and solution. Hydraulic action is the force of moving water on the land. Fast-flowing water forces out loose rock and soil from the riverbed and banks. Over time the banks collapse. Soft rocks are eroded faster than harder ones. (Differential erosion) Abrasion is the wearing away of the riverbed by its load. Stones carried by the river scrape away and smooth the river channel as they move along, deepening and widening the river channel. Solution occurs when river water dissolves the soft rock over which it flows. The erosion process as mentioned above combine to form waterfalls in the youthful stage of a river's course. Waterfalls occur where a band of hard rock, example granite, lies across the river's bed. Soft rock (e.g. shale) is eroded more quickly. Gradually a small fall forms in the river bed. The hydraulic force of water and abrasion combine to deep in the fall. A plunge pool forms at the base of the waterfall due to erosion caused by the weight of the water and the stones carried by the river over the hard rock. Water also splashes against the back wall of the waterfall and the road is it by the process of solution. Eventually the overhanging piece of rock collapses and slowly the waterfall moves or retreats upstream. Sometimes a steep sided gorge is formed if headward erosion forms very quickly undersides of the valley have not had time to be widened by mass movement.","title":"Waterfalls - Essay"},{"location":"Geography/Waterfalls%20-%20Essay/#waterfalls","text":"What you need to do: Name the landform.

Main industries were iron and steel manufacturing and shipbuilding. Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company produced over 1,000 ships. Over 11,000 people lived and worked in jarrow. Decline After WWI Palmers shipyard suffered. Problems were worsened by the Great Depression. In 1931, the steelworks in jarrow closed down. 3,000 people lost their jobs. The town now depended on palmers shipyard. The yard was taken over by the National Shipbuilders Security Ltd. The National Shipbuilders Security Ltd was set up to reduce the capacity of the industry by buying shipyards and closing them down allowing the work to go to the shipyards in other areas, e.g. London. In 1934 the National Shipbuilders Security Ltd closed down and sold off Palmers, 5,000 people lost their jobs. The site was dismantled and no shipbuilding could be carried on in the land for 40 years. This was a deliberate policy against the north. Unemployment leaped from 41% in 1922 to 72% in 1932. Only 100 out of the 8,000 skilled workers were employed in Jarrow. Unemployment added to the existing problems of a depressed area; poverty, over-crowding, poor housing and high mortality. A proposal to build a new steelworks in Jarrow was blocked by the British Iron and Steele Federation. Walter Runciman, the president of the Board of Trade told the people of Jarrow that they must \" Work out its own salvation \" Jarrow would petition the government. Organisation of the Crusade On the 20th July 1936, Jarrow Borough Council decided to organize a march to petition the government. Considerable planning was needed so a March Committee was set up to plan the route. Stops along the 300 mile journey were decided. 200 men were selected for the march, 11000 volunteered. The council raised \u00a31,500 to fund the march, including pocket money for the men and their train fare back from London. The crusade was supported by The Labour party and The Conservative party. The council did not want the march to be associated with the Communist hunger marches so it was named a crusade. It was also named a crusade to reflect the religious background of the area. The Progress of the Crusade 11,000 Jarrow people and 68,000 Tyneside signed the petitions. Marches set off from the town hall led by the mayor, local councillors and Ellen Wilkinson (Labour member of Parliament for Jarrow). They began marching at 08:45 each day and marched an average of 13 miles per day. They were usually warmly welcomed and fed in the towns where they stopped. The leaders presented the case of Jarrow at public meetings in the towns. Many people praised the organization of the march and the conduct pf the men. The leaders' speeches followed consistent themes: The causes of Jarrow's unemployment problems and a call on the government to provide jobs for the town. London and Home The men arrived to London on Saturday, 31st of October, led into the city by Ellen Wilkinson, The Mayor, 11 councillors and Paddy, the mascot dog.. The crusade made little immediate impact. the marchers held a demonstration at Hyde Park on November 1st. Stanley Baldwin (Prime Minister) refused to meet a delegation of marchers. The men were disappointed. The Assistance Board reduced their unemployment benefit. Assessment The Jarrow March or Crusade achieved its first aim of presenting a petition to Parliament. In contrast to other similar marches, it didn't alienate the general public. It achieved a certain fame through its organized and orderly manner. The March failed in its main aim of getting the government to provide jobs for the area. Jarrow's economy improved in the next few years but this had little to do with the crusade. Instead private industry, driven by rearmament as the Second World War approached, gradually filled the gap for the unemployed of Jarrow. In 1938, a ship-breaking yard and engineering works were set up, and a year later a steelworks. Along with the other hunger marches, it sparked the conscience of the middle classes. Symbolized despair of unemployed men and depressed areas. 'The Jarrow march is, indeed, a symbol of the feeling of neglect and unmerited poverty and dependence which pervades the distressed areas.' The effect of mass unemployment in the 1920s and 1930s contributed to the setting up of the Welfare State in Britain after the Second World War. During the Second World War, the British government published the Beveridge Report. It recommended a minimum standard of living, social welfare and education.","title":"The Jarrow Crusade (March-October 1936)"},{"location":"History/Jarrow/#introduction","text":"Jarrow - A depressed town in north east England.

Annual party rally held in Nuremberg each August or September. Julius Streicher made Nuremberg into the 'holy city' of the Nazi movement. The Nazi Party held its first rally in Munich (1923). It wasn't until 1927 that the rallies were moved to Nuremberg. Prior to Hitler's coming to power, the rallies were used to show the strength of the Nazi Party and to impress German public opinion. It was not until 1933, after Hitler came to power, that the Nuremberg Rallies took on the shape so well known to the world. Albert Speer was involved in the organization of the 1933 rally. Hitler and Speer wanted to create buildings which would last 1,000 years. Hitler believed in Speers theory of ' ruin value ' - that ancient ruins provided proof of the greatness of previous civilizations. These buildings would demonstrate Nazi Power and reflect the glory Hitler planned for Germany. The rallies were used to: 1. Glorify Hitler 2. Spread Nazi ideology 3. Mobilize the mass of the German people one way of spreading Nazi propaganda was that each rally had a different theme, usually celebrating recent Nazi achievements. In 1933, the Nazis celebrated their rise to power in the Rally of Victory . In 1934, the Nazis emphasized the oneness of Germany in the Rally of Unity and strength . Leni Riefensthal filmed Triumph of the Will at this rally. In 1935, the Rally of Freedom celebrated breaking the Treaty of Versailles with the introduction of conscription. In 1935 the Nuremberg Laws against the Jews were passed at a special meeting of the reichstag in the city. In 1936, the Nazis celebrated the remilitarization of the Rhineland in the Rally of Honor . In 1937, the Rally of Greater Germany celebrated the Union with Austria (Anchluss) in that year. Hitler used the occasion of the rally to put pressure on Czechoslovakia (and also Britain and France) over the Sudetenland. The * Munich Conference was held shortly after this rally resulting in the transfer of the Sudetenland to Germany. The Nazis named the rally in 1939 as the Rally of Peace but this was cancelled when the German army invaded Poland. Triumph of the Will showed how the cult of Hitler was promoted. At the beginning, Hitler is seen descending by plane from the clouds as a modern-day savior coming to save his people. Leni Riefensthal was commissioned by Hitler in 1934 to film the Nuremberg rally. Nuremberg became a giant stage with flags, banners, marches and torches. Riefensthal used 30 cameramen and over 100 technicians. Triumph of the Will is often regarded as one of the masterpieces of film propaganda. In 1935, the Reichstag had a meeting in Nuremberg on the last day of the Rally, here it passed the Nuremberg laws against the jews. Jews became second-class citizens.
