# Natural Numbers ($\mathbb{N}$)

&nbsp;

- Set of all positive and whole numbers excluding $0$&nbsp;

e.g. - {${1,2,3,4 ...}$}

- Prime numbers are natural numbers that have exactly two factors.

- $1$ is not a prime number.

- $2$ is the only even prime number.

- Composite numbers are natural numbers greater than $1$ which are not prime.

- Every natural number greater than $1$ is either a prime or can be written as a unique product of primes.

- Factor or divisor of a natural number is any number that divides exactly into it.

- Multiples of a natural number are the numbers of which it divides into exactly.

- Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two or more natural numbers is the highest number that divides exactly into both given number.

- Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers is the smallest multiple that the given number has in common.

### Examples
$\text{e.g. 1 - Express 240 as a product of primes.}$
```
            240
              / \
           (2) 120
                / \
              (2) 60
                  / \
                (2) 30
                    / \
                  (2) 15
                      / \
                    (3) (5)
```
$240 = 2\times2\times2\times2\times3\times5$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$=2^4\times3\times5$

$\text{e.g. 2 - Find (i) the HCF and (ii) the LCM of 512 and 280.}$

$512=\enclose{circle}{2}\times\enclose{circle}{2}\times\enclose{circle}{2}\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $280=\enclose{circle}{2}\times\enclose{circle}{2}\times\enclose{circle}{2}\times5\times7$

$512=2^9$

$\text{HCF}=2^3=8$

$\text{LCM}=2^3\times2^6\times5\times7=17920$

# Integers ($\mathbb{I}$)

&nbsp;

- Set of all whole numbers, positive, negative and $0$.

e.g. - {${... -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 ...}$}

**Properties of Integers**

If $a,b,c$ are integers:

- $a+b$ and $a \times b$ are integers

- Commutative property: $(a+b) = (b+a)$ and $ab=ba$
