# Natural Numbers ($\mathbb{N}$)

&nbsp;

- Set of all positive and whole numbers excluding $0$&nbsp;

e.g. - {${1,2,3,4 ...}$}

- Prime numbers are natural numbers that have exactly two factors.

- $1$ is not a prime number.

- $2$ is the only even prime number.

- Composite numbers are natural numbers greater than $1$ which are not prime.

- Every natural number greater than $1$ is either a prime or can be written as a unique product of primes.

- Factor or divisor of a natural number is any number that divides exactly into it.

- Multiples of a natural number are the numbers of which it divides into exactly.

- Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two or more natural numbers is the highest number that divides exactly into both given number.

- Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers is the smallest multiple that the given number has in common.

### Examples of HCF and LCM
$\text{e.g. 1 - Express 240 as a product of primes.}$
```
              240
              / \
           (2)  120
                / \
              (2) 60
                  / \
                (2) 30
                    / \
                  (2) 15
                      / \
                    (3) (5)
```
$240 = 2\times2\times2\times2\times3\times5$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$=2^4\times3\times5$

$\text{e.g. 2 - Find (i) the HCF and (ii) the LCM of 512 and 280.}$

$512={2}\times{2}\times{2}\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $280={2}\times{2}\times{2}\times5\times7$

$512=2^9$

$\text{HCF}=2^3=8$

$\text{LCM}=2^3\times2^6\times5\times7=17920$

# Integers ($\mathbb{z}$)

&nbsp;

- Set of all whole numbers, positive, negative and $0$.

e.g. - {${... -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 ...}$}

&nbsp;

If $a,b,c$ are integers:

- $a+b$ and $a \times b$ are integers

- Commutative property: $(a+b) = (b+a)$ and $ab=ba$

- Associative property: $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ and $(ab)c=a(bc)$

- Distributive property: $a(b+c)=ab+ac$

---
&nbsp;

# Rational Numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$)

&nbsp;

- Set of numbers that can be written as a ratio of two integers ${p}\over{q}$ where $p,q\in\mathbb{z},q\neq0$

- A rational number will have a decimal expansion that is either terminating or recurring.

- Any fraction whose denominator's prime factors are not only $2$ and/or $5$ is a recurring decimal.

- if ${p}\over{q}$ is a rational number, and $p\neq0$, then ${q}\over{p}$ is its reciprocal.

---
&nbsp;

# Real Numbers ($\mathbb{R}$)

&nbsp;

- The set of real numbers is the set of all rational and irrational numbers.

&nbsp;

---
&nbsp;

# Irrational Numbers ($\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}$) or ($\mathbb{I}$)

&nbsp;

- Set of numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers ${p}\over{q}$ where $p,q\in\mathbb{z},q\neq0$

- A surd ($\sqrt{xyz}$) is an irrational number containing a root term, i.e. $\sqrt{2}=1.414213562....$, this number will continue indefinitely and has no pattern.

-  $\pi$ and $e$ are two more examples of irrational numbers.

Note: $\mathbb{N}\subset\mathbb{Z}\subset\mathbb{Q}\subset\mathbb{R}$

# Proof that $\sqrt2$ is irrational (Proof by Contradiction)

We will use proof by contradiction to prove: $\sqrt2$ is irrational.

Proof: Assume that $\sqrt2$ is rational and can therefore be written in the form of ${p}\over{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ have no common factors.

$\sqrt2 = \frac{p}{q} \Rightarrow 2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$

$\therefore p^2 = 2q^2$

$\text{let }p=2k$

$\Rightarrow p^2=4k^2$

$p^2=2q^2\text{ and }p^2=4k^2$

$\Rightarrow 2q^2=4k^2$

$\Rightarrow q^2=2k^2$

$2$ is a factor of $q^2$, so $2$ is also a factor of $q$

Therefore $2$ is a common factor of $p$ and $q$, this contradicts the original assumption. Thus $\sqrt2$ is an irrational number.

# Construct $\sqrt2$

![](https://ptpimg.me/1d4t4q.jpg)

&nbsp;

Proof:

$|ab|=|bc|=1$    (radii of circle)

$|ab|^2+|bc|^2=|ac|^2$

$1^2+1^2=|ac|^2$

$2=|ac|^2$

$\sqrt2=|ac|$

# Construct $\sqrt3$

&nbsp;

![](https://ptpimg.me/x425hb.jpg)

&nbsp;

Proof:

$[CD]$ and $[AB]$ are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

$\therefore |AE|=\frac{1}{2}|AB|=1$

$|AC|=1$ (Construction)

$|AE|^2+|EC|^2=|AC|^2$

$(\frac{1}{2})^2+|EC|^2=1^2$

$|EC|^2=1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$

$\therefore |EC|=\sqrt\frac{3}{4}=\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$

$|CD|=2|EC|=2(\frac{\sqrt3}{2})$

$\therefore|CD|=\sqrt3$
