# Show Trials

- Enemies:
  Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev.&nbsp;

- Trotsky escaped, many saw him as a hero and wanted his return.&nbsp;

- Stalin sought to destroy them, (Accusations of plotting against Russia / against Stalin and working with fascists).&nbsp;

- Trials were to destroy their reputations forever.&nbsp;

- Carried out by the NKVD&nbsp;

- First in charge of the NKVD: Yagoda (1934-1936)&nbsp;

- Later Yezhov (nicknamed "The Poison Dwarf") (1932-1938)&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;◦  Later part of the policy against ordinary citizens known as the Yezhovshcina.&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- Then Beria after the arrest of Yezhov.&nbsp;

- Three main show trials.&nbsp;

- Senior Communist party leaders were tried in public.&nbsp;

- These trials were part of Stalin's efforts to ensure greater power for himself.&nbsp;

- Even though Trotsky was in exile, he was as much on trial as they were.&nbsp;

- They were branded as terrorist groups of Trotskyites.&nbsp;

- They were also accused of conspiring with Nazi Germany.&nbsp;

- Zinoviev broke first, he was used to get a confession from Kamenev.&nbsp;

- Once the confessions were signed, the defendants had to memorize their lines for the trial.&nbsp;

- Stalin used the Show Trials to discipline the Soviet Population.&nbsp;

- He eliminated the old Bolsheviks.&nbsp;

- Used the trials as propaganda.&nbsp;

*"Our beloved leader and teacher - The great Stalin"* - Vyshinsky (Prosecutor)&nbsp;

- Show Trials created a veneer of justice.&nbsp;

- Many foreign observers believed the trials were legal and that there was a conspiracy against the soviet union.&nbsp;

# The Purges

- By 1938, 1 in 8 citizens has been arrested at some point in the purges. &nbsp;

- Almost every family had lost at least one member as a victim of the terror. &nbsp;

- The fear and suspicion generated by the purges in society had secured Stalins hold on power but now threatened to cripple the USSR.&nbsp;

- The purges that secured Stalins hold on power generated more labour within the gulags.&nbsp;

- The purges caused immense damage to the operational capacity of the USSR armed forces.&nbsp;

- In 1938 the Red Army was in an appalling state on the eve of WWII.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; ◦  This was highlighted by their poor performance in the Winter War (1939-1940) with Finland.&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- Morale within the USSR was poor.&nbsp;

- Stalin was still popular but in great danger; he was perhaps saved by the unifying force of Nazism.&nbsp;
