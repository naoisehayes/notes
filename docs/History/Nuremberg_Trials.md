# Nuremberg Rallies

- Mass rallies were an integral part of **Nazi organisation and propaganda**.

- Annual party rally held in Nuremberg each August or September.

- Julius Streicher made Nuremberg into the 'holy city' of the Nazi movement.

- The Nazi Party held its first rally in Munich (1923).

- It wasnt until 1927 that the rallies were moved to Nuremberg.

- Prior to Hitler's coming to power, the rallies were used to show the strength of the Nazi Party and to impress German public opinion.

- It was not until 1933, after Hitler came to power, that the Nuremberg Rallies took on the shape so well kniwn to the world.

- Albert Speer was involved in the organisation of the 1933 rally.

- Hitler and Speer wanted to create buildings which would last 1,000 years.

- Hitler believed in Speers theory of '**ruin value**' - that ancient ruins provided proof of the greatness of previous civilisations.

- These buildings would demonstrate Nazi Power and reflect the glory Hitler planned for Germany.

- The rallies were used to:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Glorify Hitler

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Spread Nazi ideology

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Mobilse the mass of the German people

- one way of spreding Nazi propaganda was that each rally had a different theme, usually celebrating recent Nazi achievements.

- In 1934, the Nazis celebrated their rise to power in the **Rally of Victory**.

- In 1934, the Nazis emphasised the oneness of Germany in the **Rally of Unity and strength**. Leni Riefensthal filmed *Triumph of the Will* at this rally.

- In 1935, the **Rally of Freedom** celebrated breaking the Treaty of Versailles with the introduction of concription.

- In 1935 the **Nuremberg Laws** against the Jews were passed at a special meeting of the reichstag in the city.

- In 1936, the Nazis celebrated the remilitarisation of the Rhineland in the **Rally of Honour**.

- In 1937, the **Rally of Greater Germany** celebrated the Union with Austria (Anchluss) in that year.

- Hitler used the occasion of the rally to put pressure on Czechoslovakia (and also Britain and France) over the Sudetenland. The **Munich Conference* was held shortly after this rally resulting in the transfer of the Sudetenland to Germany.

- The Nazis named the rally in 1939 as the **Rally of Peace** but this was cancelled when the German army invaded Poland.

- *Triumph of the Will* showed how the cult of Hitler was promoted. At the beginning, Hitler is seen descending by plane from the clouds as a modern-day saviour coming to save his people.

- Leni Riefensthal was commissioned by Hitler in 1934 to film the Nuremberg rally. Nuremberg became a giant stage with flags, banners, marches and torches.

- Riefensthal used 30 cameramen and over 100 technicians. Triumph of the Will is often regarded as one of the masterpieces of film propaganda.

- In 1935, the Reichstag had a meeting in Nuremberg on the last day of the Rally, here it passed the Nuremberg laws against the jews. Jews became second-class citizens.

- The 1939 Rally had the theme **Rally of Peace** but it was canceled due to the outbreak of the Second World War on September 1st 1939.

- By then Nuremberg became a key symbol for the Nazis, This along with its role as a center of war production led to massive Allied bombing which flattened most of the city.

- After the war, the US Army held a victory parade there and blew up the swastika which was behind the reviewing stand. The trials of the Nazi war criminals were deliberatley held in the city.
