                <h1 id="nuremberg-rallies">Nuremberg Rallies</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mass rallies were an integral part of <strong>Nazi organization and propaganda</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annual party rally held in Nuremberg each August or September.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Julius Streicher made Nuremberg into the 'holy city' of the Nazi movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Nazi Party held its first rally in Munich (1923).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It wasn't until 1927 that the rallies were moved to Nuremberg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to Hitler's coming to power, the rallies were used to show the strength of the Nazi Party and to impress German public opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was not until 1933, after Hitler came to power, that the Nuremberg Rallies took on the shape so well known to the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Albert Speer was involved in the organization of the 1933 rally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hitler and Speer wanted to create buildings which would last 1,000 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hitler believed in Speers theory of '<strong>ruin value</strong>' - that ancient ruins provided proof of the greatness of previous civilizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These buildings would demonstrate Nazi Power and reflect the glory Hitler planned for Germany.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rallies were used to:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Glorify Hitler</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Spread Nazi ideology</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Mobilize the mass of the German people</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>one way of spreading Nazi propaganda was that each rally had a different theme, usually celebrating recent Nazi achievements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1933, the Nazis celebrated their rise to power in the <strong>Rally of Victory</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1934, the Nazis emphasized the oneness of Germany in the <strong>Rally of Unity and strength</strong>. Leni Riefensthal filmed <em>Triumph of the Will</em> at this rally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1935, the <strong>Rally of Freedom</strong> celebrated breaking the Treaty of Versailles with the introduction of conscription.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1935 the <strong>Nuremberg Laws</strong> against the Jews were passed at a special meeting of the reichstag in the city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1936, the Nazis celebrated the remilitarization of the Rhineland in the <strong>Rally of Honor</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1937, the <strong>Rally of Greater Germany</strong> celebrated the Union with Austria (Anchluss) in that year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hitler used the occasion of the rally to put pressure on Czechoslovakia (and also Britain and France) over the Sudetenland. The *<em>Munich Conference</em> was held shortly after this rally resulting in the transfer of the Sudetenland to Germany.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Nazis named the rally in 1939 as the <strong>Rally of Peace</strong> but this was cancelled when the German army invaded Poland.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Triumph of the Will</em> showed how the cult of Hitler was promoted. At the beginning, Hitler is seen descending by plane from the clouds as a modern-day savior coming to save his people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leni Riefensthal was commissioned by Hitler in 1934 to film the Nuremberg rally. Nuremberg became a giant stage with flags, banners, marches and torches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Riefensthal used 30 cameramen and over 100 technicians. Triumph of the Will is often regarded as one of the masterpieces of film propaganda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1935, the Reichstag had a meeting in Nuremberg on the last day of the Rally, here it passed the Nuremberg laws against the jews. Jews became second-class citizens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 1939 Rally had the theme <strong>Rally of Peace</strong> but it was canceled due to the outbreak of the Second World War on September 1st 1939.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By then Nuremberg became a key symbol for the Nazis, This along with its role as a center of war production led to massive Allied bombing which flattened most of the city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the war, the US Army held a victory parade there and blew up the swastika which was behind the reviewing stand. The trials of the Nazi war criminals were deliberately held in the city.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="propaganda">Propaganda</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Propaganda is the use of the media to promote one point of view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Propaganda is brainwashing the public, convincing them of an idealogical viewpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>He was responsible for running the Nazi Propaganda machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tasked with ensuring the views of the Nazi party were persuasive.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Gobbels described the radio as "The spiritual weapon of the totalitarian state"</p>
</li>
